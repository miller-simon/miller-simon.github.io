  <h1>Past work</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">I have experience using data. This data has included digital footprints, interview and performance ratings, macroeconomic aggregates,
	match outcomes in sports, medical scans, and text. The thread tying these seemingly-disparate experiences together is my use of data to parse through
	noise and identify signals. Below are some previous efforts to uncover signals.</p>
  
  <h4><a href="https://github.com/miller-simon/factor_analysis" style="color:#660404;">Factor analysis with Big Five traits</a></h4>
  <p><i>December 2021</i><br>I explored using the semopy package to conduct factor analysis using results from a personality assessment. After
	doing some modeling, I explored how the five factors varied with gender, education, and age in the respondent population. It was fun to learn a 
	new technique, popular in an interesting problem space.</p>

  <h4><a href="https://github.com/miller-simon/movies_nlp" style="color:#660404;">Movie review NLP</a></h4>
  <p><i>October 2021</i><br>I did some basic exploratory analysis of movie review text from NLTK and built a few simple models to classify positive and negative movie reviews.
	This was insightful because it helped expand how I think about "data." Information outside of raw numbers can generate insights. Sometimes
	identifying these insights requires thinking deeply about a topic. Other times, this can be automated.</p>
  
  <a href="https://github.com/miller-simon/nfl_elo" style="color:#660404;"><h4>NFL power rankings</h4></a>
  <p><i>August 2021</i><br>I scraped NFL game data and modified open-source code to capture historical power rankings in the NFL. I then ran a basic simulation to estimate
	each team's odds of becoming the Super Bowl champion. The work is not quite ready for Vegas, but was a fun programming challenge.</p>
  
  <a href="projects/thesis.pdf" style="color:#660404;"><h4>&mu;MRI reconstruction</h4></a>
  <p><i>December 2020</i><br>I completed my honors thesis, <i>Improvement of Image Reconstruction Techniques for &mu;MRI</i>, under the guidance of Dr. Yang Xia and Dr. Farid Badar. This was a great opportunity to apply my generalist skills in a domain I was unfamiliar with. I knew Matlab upon entering the
	lab, but had no experience with medical physics. With the help of the lab, I was able gain an understanding of the necessary science and developed an 
	algorithm that reconstructed images from the lab's radially sampled &mu;MRI data. Technically, I grew a lot and independently grappling with 
	uncertainty and developing code for extended periods of time was indispensable to my personal and professional growth.</p>
  
  <a href="https://youtu.be/J6r2G88a7PU" style="color:#660404;"><h4>Optimizing electricity generation</h4></a>
  <p><i>December 2020</i><br>I developed models for electricity generation as part of a business analytics course. This was a large-scale optimization problem,
	considering production decisions involving 7 sources of electricity every 5 minutes, for 24 hours. I learned about Excel, OpenSolver, and @RISK. I
	deeply enjoyed the project because it allowed me to tackle problem identification, modeling, and analysis of results in a domain that interests me.</p>
  
  <a href="projects/policy_brief.pdf" style="color:#660404;"><h4>Dynamic pricing of electricity</h4></a>
  <p><i>November 2020</i><br>I evaluated different implementations of dynamic pricing of electricity as part of an energy economics course. I enjoyed this policy brief because it 
	required me to review both quantitative and qualitative arguments in economics. While inefficiencies exist in the electricity market,
	public discomfort with an extremely volatile pricing schema will likely prevent the United States from resolving these inefficiencies for some time.</p>
  
  <a href="projects/tax_innovation.pdf" style="color:#660404;"><h4>State income taxation and innovation</h4></a>
  <p><i>December 2019</i><br>I conducted an analysis of state-level data to determine the effects that corporate and personal income taxation policies had on innovative productivity
	as part of an econometrics course. Joint significance among testing independent variables was present. Putting this work together helped me grow a lot. I learned
	fundamental econometrics principles and put them to use to address a question that piqued my interest. It was also my first experience
	gathering and cleaning my own data set.</p>
