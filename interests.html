  <h1>Interests</h1>
  <p style ="text-align: center">I like to solve problems. These are the areas I often turn to.</p>
  <h3>Mathematics and statistics</h3>
  <p>I enjoy the beauty of math and recognize it as a powerful tool. I'm excited about the ability to describe and predict physical
	and social phenomena using numbers. I enjoy building models and running simulations
	to draw inferences and create recommendations.</p>
  <h3>Computing</h3>
  <p>My interests in computing are mostly practical. I like implementing and using methods to solve problems and answer questions. Computing is simply the
	best platform to achieve this. Python is my current go-to tool due to the great open-source solutions that exist to support data work. Outside of
	Python, I've built and tested methods with Matlab. Agnostic of language, I like to write and use code to make things better and illuminate insights.
 	</p>
  <h3>Economics</h3>
  <p>I am drawn to economics because of it's ability to describe and prescribe. Intersections with behavioral science, human capital, and public
	policy are my favorite. Our ability to describe and prescribe in these domains is often questionable, but the areas we fall short are often
	the most exciting.</p>
